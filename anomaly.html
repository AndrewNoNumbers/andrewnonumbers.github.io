                    <h2>Problem exploration and convergence</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I was brought on, Anomaly was a small team of engineers who had pivoted away from web3 security. They wanted to try to use LLMs to automate third-party warranty claims adjudication, but had only a vague idea of how it would be done on the UX front.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I quickly picked up what the team had already learned about third-party administrators (TPAs) and how the industry worked. The team had scheduled upcoming conversations with TPAs who were exploring LLMs and were thus open to exploring how the team could accelerate their AI transformation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The general opportunity was understood: warranty claims were a very manual process. Claims require call center agents to manually ask additional questions, make a decision, and send payment info. These call centers faced the challenge of high employee turnover and lots of training for new employees.

                    <figcaption>Most TPAs either require calling in to file a claim, or have a basic online form that requires human follow up</figcaption>

                        Anomaly believed this could be better done by AI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The question was how? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I realized that until we landed a customer, it would be hard to dig into the agent side to understand how to make claims more efficient on that side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, in order to pitch to TPAs, we needed to show that we've thought of a preliminary solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having identified that as the goal, I realized the team had a knowledge gap in how claims are currently submitted by service centers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bringing my knowledge with guerilla research, I scanned r/serviceadvisors to learn the lingo and standards of the space and leveraged a post to schedule 6 service advisors to talk to. There was so much interest I had to remove the scheduling link the next morning since we had more participants than needed.

                    <h3>Problem opportunities that arose from talking to service advisors about 3p warranties</h3>

                    <p>By involving engineering and product in these interivews, I was able to bring them along the discovery process.

                    <h4>IRF service advisors report the most pain and dissatisfaction with 3p warranties</h4>
                    <p>Dealer service advisors are more likely to deal with their own in-house warranty product, to use an online portal for claims submissions, and are less likely to say it's painful. IRF service advisors are more likely to use the phone for claims filing and often report negative experiences &mdash; for example being on hold for an hour, playing phone tag with the TPA agent, or having disagreements about parts cost</p>

                    <h4>Several pain points found for service advisors</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Being on hold with TPA</li>
                        <li>Having back-and-forths with TPA on parts pricing</li>
                        <li>Customers believing that the warranty product should cover the entire bill</li>
                        <li>Asking customers to pay the part of the bill not covered by their warranty</li>
                        <li>Having to keep their customer updated on the status of the warranty claim</li>
                        <li>The TPA requiring additional evidence, like proof of oil changes, which the service advisor then has the ask the customer for</li>
                    </ul>

                    



                    <p>Usually at this point, it's a good idea to narrow down and prioritize one problem to solve. However, due to the client's circumstances, I was tasked with designing a prototype that solves for all of these pain points.</p>

                    <h2>Solution exploration and convergence</h2>

                    <p>Because the client had a very tight deadline for showing our claims submission solution to potential customers, I took the approach of producing a "best guess flow" based on A) initial conversations with service advisors and B) the team's institutional knowledge.</p>

                    <p>I then iterated on the flow and UI details based on additional feedback sessions with service advisors who opted in to the customer development program I started.</p>

                    <p>This approach makes account creation an implicit part of the claim submission flow. This is based on my research that showed service advisors find value in having one place to follow up on claims, yet had some hesitancy about creating accounts.</p>
                    <p>From my research, I found that different service advisors had different preferred ways of communicating with TPAs &mdash; some liked the immediacy of phone, others always prefer email.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Service advisors have an industry standard terminology, the 3 C's &mdash; complaint, cause, correction &mdash; and they expect the repair entry to reflect that rather than some alternative wording</li>
                        <li>Usually parts and labor are not lumped together, but rather separated into different jobs, and each job usually needs to be matched to a single complaint + cause</li>
                        <li>Photos need to be uploaded as part of a specific job, not as part of the entire claim</li>

                    <figcaption>After the service advisor inputs their repair, our software analyzes the repair and asks follow-up questions.

                        While the client's number one request was product mockups to demonstrate to customers, the added value of my work with Anomaly was in producing research that helped the team reorient to a problem space and to build up the muscle (and customer development program) to regularly co-design with users. As the team onboards TPAs, the next step will be to run this discovery and design process with call center agents at third-party warranty providers to learn their pain points and see how software can make their work better.

                                    I had the pleasure of working alongside Andrew at a 0 to 1 tele-health start up for 6 months. He cares deeply about the customer journey and designing useful (&fun!) experiences. Instrumental in quickly turning around a beautiful pitch deck for potential partnership. His designs are elegant and effective. Great teammate and an asset to any start up!

                                    Andrew worked with us to turn an ambiguous product vision into tangible mockups and prototypes that we were able to test with customers, and eventually raise a seed round for. Andrew has a keen product sense, even for a highly technical product like ours. He’d be a great asset for any founding teams navigating the 0 to 1 stage.

                                    Fantastic designer: eager to collaborate, skilled at coming up with creative solutions to difficult UX challenges, great communicator. Very small ego and a joy to work with. Andrew is my go-to designer any time I have a difficult UX problem often resulting in me walking away from the conversation with a, "Now why didn't I think of that?"

                                    Andrew is quick to action and puts his excellent visual design skills to work. He's highly responsive, circumspect, and iterative in his designs. Andrew brought a wonderful vivacity to the Alation design team, diving right into new content, processes, and critiques, while always staying focused on ways for himself and the team improve. He would be a great addition to any design team.

                                    Andrew and I worked together when he was interning at Curology. It was a pleasure to work together with Andrew who always brought a lot of excitement for working in design and learning new things. I'm impressed by the way he was able to tackle difficult UX challenges. He always sought to learn more and contribute to the team, including a lot of work around accessibility.
