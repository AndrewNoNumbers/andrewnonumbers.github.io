                    <h2>Problem exploration and convergence</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I was brought on, Anomaly was a small team of engineers who had pivoted away from web3 security. They wanted to try to use LLMs to automate third-party warranty claims adjudication, but had only a vague idea of how it would be done on the UX front.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I quickly picked up what the team had already learned about third-party administrators (TPAs) and how the industry worked. The team had scheduled upcoming conversations with TPAs who were exploring LLMs and were thus open to exploring how the team could accelerate their AI transformation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The general opportunity was understood: warranty claims were a very manual process. Claims require call center agents to manually ask additional questions, make a decision, and send payment info. These call centers faced the challenge of high employee turnover and lots of training for new employees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anomaly believed this could be better done by AI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The question was how? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I realized that until we landed a customer, it would be hard to dig into the agent side to understand how to make claims more efficient on that side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, in order to pitch to TPAs, we needed to show that we've thought of a preliminary solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having identified that as the goal, I realized the team had a knowledge gap in how claims are currently submitted by service centers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bringing my knowledge with guerilla research, I scanned r/serviceadvisors to learn the lingo and standards of the space and leveraged a post to schedule 6 service advisors to talk to. There was so much interest I had to remove the scheduling link the next morning since we had more participants than needed.

                                    I had the pleasure of working alongside Andrew at a 0 to 1 tele-health start up for 6 months. He cares deeply about the customer journey and designing useful (&fun!) experiences. Instrumental in quickly turning around a beautiful pitch deck for potential partnership. His designs are elegant and effective. Great teammate and an asset to any start up!

                                    Andrew worked with us to turn an ambiguous product vision into tangible mockups and prototypes that we were able to test with customers, and eventually raise a seed round for. Andrew has a keen product sense, even for a highly technical product like ours. He’d be a great asset for any founding teams navigating the 0 to 1 stage.

                                    Andrew is quick to action and puts his excellent visual design skills to work. He's highly responsive, circumspect, and iterative in his designs. Andrew brought a wonderful vivacity to the Alation design team, diving right into new content, processes, and critiques, while always staying focused on ways for himself and the team improve. He would be a great addition to any design team.

                                    Andrew and I worked together when he was interning at Curology. It was a pleasure to work together with Andrew who always brought a lot of excitement for working in design and learning new things. I'm impressed by the way he was able to tackle difficult UX challenges. He always sought to learn more and contribute to the team, including a lot of work around accessibility.
