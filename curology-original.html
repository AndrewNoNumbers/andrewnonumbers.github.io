                        In 2020, Curology was in the development phases of a new Progress feature. While previously patients reported on their progress via messages to the clinical team, with this new feature patients are asked about their skin progress (both good and bad) through the Curology website. The team hopes that this new Progress feature will result in better prescription efficacy, more brand trust, and more efficiency for the clinical team.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I partnered with another product designer, E, on this project. E took the patient-facing UI, and I took the clinician-facing UI.

                    <h2>Collaborating with a big team</h2>

                    <p>
                        As the designer of the clinician side of the Progress feature, I led problem definition via conversations with the medical team lead, the resident UX researcher, product manager, and CTO.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Understanding the complexity</h2>
                    <p>
                        In an ambiguous project, the most important thing is to get a sense of what's set in stone, or the constraints.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this case, what's set in stone were the questions that we would ask patients via the Progress feature, which were co-developed by the product manager and medical team lead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Looking at these questions closely, I could categorize the questions based on ones that have magnitudinal answers and ones that don't, as well as ones that had corresponding icons in our design system and ones that don't.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column lg-8 tab-12">
                    <h2>Divergent exploration</h2>
                    <p class="drop-cap">
                        With a semantic understanding of the questions and their answer choices, I pulled out a sketchbook to explore ways to present these questions and answers using interaction and UI paradigms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal of this exploration, which I shared in sketch form with E, the product manager, and the engineering team as early concepts, is to get early buy-in and learn the usability benefits and downsides for the clinicians.
                    </p>

                    <div class="row">

                    <p>
                        While these sketches may seem rough, they are only meant to capture the concept. With a well-defined design system, I was able to quickly mock them up into our clinician UI and even simulate interactions.

                        Because we are building this new data visualizer into an existing piece of software which clinicians are highly proficient at, I needed to understand whether these UI paradigms work with existing use patterns that are, at this point, muscle memory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few things surfaced in my observations of clinicians:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Clinicans are accustomed to scrolling up and down in the UI, because the UI represents a timeline of the patient's communication and prescription adjustments.</li>
                        <li>Clinicians use keyboard shortcuts to navigate this UI efficiently.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        A few things also came up regarding how they would use Progress submission data:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Clinicians weigh all the answers we collect in the Progress feature fairly equally, meaning there is not clear hierarchy of questions that are more important than others.</li>
                        <li>Clinicians look at photos almost all the time, but usually not before reading the data, because photos without context are not helpful.</li>
                    </ol>

                        <li>The progress questions can and will change as a patient moves along their journey, which means the visualization may need to be adapted to different questions.</li>

                        In a project with unknowns, assumptions and constraints must be formed and agreed upon so the team can move forward, because often unknowns can't be resolved until a feature is shipped. I pushed for an alignment meeting with my product manager and a few others to make sure that we had alignments on requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>The alignment was to ship a visualization that:</p>
                    <ul>   
                        <li>Assumes an upper bound of 20 Progress submissions</li>

                        A combination of the constraints and user testing with clinicans led me to decide on the table paradigm.

                                    Andrew worked with us to turn an ambiguous product vision into tangible mockups and prototypes that we were able to test with customers, and eventually raise a seed round for. Andrew has a keen product sense, even for a highly technical product like ours. He’d be a great asset for any founding teams navigating the 0 to 1 stage.

                                    I had the pleasure of working alongside Andrew at a 0 to 1 tele-health start up for 6 months. He cares deeply about the customer journey and designing useful (&fun!) experiences. Instrumental in quickly turning around a beautiful pitch deck for potential partnership. His designs are elegant and effective. Great teammate and an asset to any start up!

                                    He took an incredibly thoughtful approach to both projects and worked cross functionally with analytics, customer success, design, and product. I was impressed with his proactiveness in looking into product metrics and his drive to interview users and internal stakeholders to gain a full understanding of the problem space. He is also eager for and receptive to feedback and has a growth mindset. He is a great person to have on your team!
