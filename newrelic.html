                        <p>Hello! This was short-term engagement I did with the docs team. As an area without a design system, the docs work required a lot of novel interaction and visual design, and also allowed me to use my experience with responsive web to ensure docs works for desktop, tablet, and mobile readers. I haven't built this project into a case study yet; however, the basics are below – please messsage me to learn more! I have a presentation ready.</p>

                        New Relic is the industry-leading all-in-one observability platform, designed to allow software developers to respond faster, optimize better, and build more perfect software.

                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>There were two main problems I was briefed on by the docs team. 1) Docs writers rely on feedback to know where to dedicate more resources, however the Docs site did not receive much feedback through its on-page feedback mechanism. 2) A UX metrics project showed that the Docs site scores low in 'Ease of use' and 'Ease of navigation' – how might we improve these scores?</p>

                <div class="column lg-12">
                    <h2>Action</h2>
                    <p>The first piece, getting more reader feedback for docs, had a very tight turnaround, and was a good opportunity for me to build trust with the team. By delivering a solution that was easily doable and took into account technical constraints, I was able to build a relationship with the Docs engineering team and Docs writers.</p>
                    <p>
                        The second piece, bumping up 'Ease of use' and 'Ease of navigation', was a more involved project that involved synthesizing research data, aligning the team on the main challenges, and coming up with a holistic navigation redesign that solved the myriad of navigation flaws while aligning the new Docs design with our design system.

                    <h2>Result</h2>
                    <p>Though there's always more to improve, this project exceeded the team's objectives. The redesigned feedback mechanism gathered much more reader feedback than the old one, allowing the Docs writer to be more agile in improving content, and also allowed the team to receive text suggestions. The navigation redesign resolved some longstanding complaints, set up the site for scale, and improved 'Ease of use' and 'Ease of navigation' scores the next time we ran the UX metrics survey.</p>

Andrew is my go-to designer any time I have a difficult UX problem often resulting in me walking away from the conversation with a, "Now why didn't I think of that?"

Andrew has a keen product sense, even for a highly technical product like ours. He’d be a great asset for any founding teams navigating the 0 to 1 stage.

                                    I had the pleasure of working alongside Andrew at a 0 to 1 tele-health start up for 6 months. He cares deeply about the customer journey and designing useful (&fun!) experiences. Instrumental in quickly turning around a beautiful pitch deck for potential partnership. His designs are elegant and effective. Great teammate and an asset to any start up!

                                    During my time working with Andrew, I immediately noticed his uncanny ability to ask precisely the right questions and welcome design challenges right out of the gate. He’s unfazed by tough UX problems, and approaches solutions with a high curiosity and ability to execute. I would hire Andrew in a heartbeat.

                                    He took an incredibly thoughtful approach to both projects and worked cross functionally with analytics, customer success, design, and product. I was impressed with his proactiveness in looking into product metrics and his drive to interview users and internal stakeholders to gain a full understanding of the problem space. He is also eager for and receptive to feedback and has a growth mindset. He is a great person to have on your team!

He would be a great addition to any design team.

                                    Andrew and I worked together when he was interning at Curology. It was a pleasure to work together with Andrew who always brought a lot of excitement for working in design and learning new things. I'm impressed by the way he was able to tackle difficult UX challenges. He always sought to learn more and contribute to the team, including a lot of work around accessibility.
