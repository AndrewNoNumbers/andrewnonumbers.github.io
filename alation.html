                        Search is the first point of contact many users have with the product. Through our Client Success Managers, we heard that not only was there confusion with the inconsistency of the search experience, it also was challenging to use for less-technical users.
                    </p>

                    <p>There was a lot of buy-in from executives to do a thorough redesign of the search experience because it would support expanding the product so that less-technical users can get value from it, thus supporting the OKR of expanding licensed seats. So the product design team kicked off the ambitious project to reimagine the whole search experience, from how search lives within the data catalog interface to how search results are displayed to how users filter results.</p>

                    <p>User need: Data users want to use search to either find an exact object they know exists, or to browse for objects that relate to an area they are investigating.</p>

                        Through my testing with internal users, I also received unsolicited feedback on how information should be placed spatially, which pointed me to thinking harder about how the information should be grouped and placed within the result card.

                            There are a few different types of information conveyed in each search result card. Some information relate only to the object, some information relate to the organization's relationship with the object, and other information relate to the user's own relationship with the object. These need to be integrated in a way that gives the object its aggregate meaning.

                            The core web search only indexes one type of information, the web page. However, a data catalog indexes a wide range of object types, from tables to columns to reports to queries. These object types are often intermixed in search results because a query may rank as prominently in a search for 'oct 2020 revenue' as a table or report. Thus in order to help users make sense of search results, object types and difference between them need to be easily understandable.

                        Through several rounds of testing, I found that while a large object type icon was good for learnability, it overwhelmed the information hierarchy and thus reduced efficiency in browsing the results. Instead, I found that users really understood objects when they are represented with the object's salient characteristics. For example, a table is more easily recognized as a table when users are able to recognize the column structure.

                        This new table preview component not only made the popular table object more tangible to new users, but it allowed an added layer of depth in seeing if the table would be helpful. This new component went through several rounds of iteration to find the most efficient display and to round out edge cases like tables with thousands of columns.

                        Megan and I periodically combined our work into a clickable prototype to test with users. Thus our projects moved in tandem. Toward the end of the project and the end of my internship, I documented the functionality of interactive elements of the search results and the table preview. We also thought about metrics by which we would evaluate the success of our designs.

                        With 2 months of iterating and testing, we imagined and specced a search that not only was easier to approach for our new customers but also improved the value of the data catalog to power users. As this feature is rolled out, the team is closely tracking task success rate, engagement, and NPS to find places for further improvement.

                        Through this project, Megan and I were able to solve customer pain points and expand Alation to a new set of less-technical users, allowing Alation to expand its market. By taking ownership of the design of the search results, I helped the product design team meet the tight deadlines and accelerated the engineering team's ability to estimate and plan the next quarter.

                                    Andrew is quick to action and puts his excellent visual design skills to work. He's highly responsive, circumspect, and iterative in his designs. Andrew brought a wonderful vivacity to the Alation design team, diving right into new content, processes, and critiques, while always staying focused on ways for himself and the team improve. He would be a great addition to any design team.

                                    Andrew and I worked together when he was interning at Curology. It was a pleasure to work together with Andrew who always brought a lot of excitement for working in design and learning new things. I'm impressed by the way he was able to tackle difficult UX challenges. He always sought to learn more and contribute to the team, including a lot of work around accessibility.
